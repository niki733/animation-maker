# animation-maker
First year university project. It is a desktop program written in Java that simulates a 5x5 pixel screen. The user can set the brightness of each pixel to a value from 0 to 255. This allows the user to create, view, save and export animations (configured frame by frame) in a special C-style format that can be played on the Micro:Bit device.

You can find the .jar file in animationsMicroBit/out/artifacts
